Lady Eleanor Glanville (c. 1654 â€“ 1709) was a 17th-century English entomologist from Tickenham in Somerset. 


== Entomologist ==

Lady Glanville was particularly interested in butterflies. She collected large numbers of butterfly specimens, many of which survive as some of the earliest specimens kept in the Natural History Museum. She would beat the hedges for "a parcel of wormes", neighbours reported.
The Glanville fritillary butterfly is named after her.


== Biography ==
Eleanor Glanville was the daughter of William Goodricke and Eleanor Davis Poyntz, daughter of Rice Davis and Mary Pitt. Eleanor Davis was the widow of Nicholas Poyntz, a descendant of the Poyntz family, anciently feudal barons of Curry Mallet in Somerset, later of Iron Acton in Gloucestershire. Eleanor Goodrick married Edmund Ashfield and after his death Richard Glanville. She pursued her interest in entomology after separating from her second husband, and tried to leave her money away from her immediate family. However, on her death, her children overturned her will, arguing that she was insane because of her hobby.

In 2009, Fiona Mountain published a novel about Glanville's life.
